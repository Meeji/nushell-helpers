# nushell-helpers
A collection of helpful nushell scripts.

I've been using nushell a bit recently, and this is where I keep my quick-and-dirty nushell helper scripts

If you happen to be reading this you should keep in mind these scripts are not very fully featured, well structured or tested (yet) and have been developed for my own use.

There are scripts for two purposes:
* Simple tasks on structured data derived from `XML` files
* Output structured data from some `dotnet` commands
